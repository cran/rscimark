Title: SciMark 2.0 Benchmark for Scientific and Numerical Computing
Description: The SciMark 2.0 benchmark was originally developed in Java as a benchmark for numerical and scientific computational performance. It measures the performance of several computational kernels which are frequently occurring in scientific applications. This package is a simple wrapper around the ANSI C implementation of the benchmark.
